Purpose and History
===================
MiXiM (mixed simulator) is a simulator for wireless and mobile networks using 
the OMNeT++ simulation engine.
MiXiM is available at http://mixim.sourceforge.net/

MiXiM is a simulation framework for the OMNeT++ simulation engine to support 
modeling and simulation of wireless and mobile networks.


The initial MiXiM version has been a merger of the following 4 simulation 
frameworks:
- ChSim
  http://www.cs.uni-paderborn.de/en/fachgebiete/research-group-computer-networks/projects/chsim.html
  (c) by Universitaet Paderborn
- Mac Simulator
  http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html
  (c) by Technische Universiteit Delft
- Mobility Framework
  http://mobility-fw.sourceforge.net/
  (c) by Technische Universitaet Berlin, Telecommunication Networks Group
- Positif Framework
  http://www.consensus.tudelft.nl/software.html
  (c) by Technische Universiteit Delft

Meanwhile many other models and projects have been integrated into MiXiM, the 
most important being:

- EnergyFramework (since MiXiM v1.1)

  (c) by Jerome Rousselot (jerome.rousselot@csem.ch)



MiXiM further includes the "Mixnet" (since MiXiM v2.0) project which provides 
compatibility modules and documentation for using MiXiM together with the INET 
framework. 
For details on Mixnet and INET please take a look at the README file in MiXiM's 
"inet" folder.

Installation
============
For installation instructions please see the INSTALL file


How to start
============
A step-by-step guide on how to start with MiXiM can be found in MiXiM's wiki at:
http://sourceforge.net/apps/trac/mixim/wiki/StepByStep

MiXiM contains wizards for the project-creation-wizard in the OMNeT++ IDE.
These are:
* a wizard to create a basic MiXiM-network by configuring the hosts from
predefines application layers, NIC protocols and mobility modules as well as 
choosing the playground topology.
* a wizard to create a simple MiXiM-network. The hosts contain an analogue model
which can be basically configured in the wizard. This network is useful to 
implement and test a new analogue model.

To create a new project using MiXiM's wizards please go to:
"File -> New -> OMNeT++ Project...", name your project, and in the next step
select the wizard to be used. It will present the configuration options
during the next step(s). When the creation process has finished, the new 
MiXiM-network is ready to be built and run.


Documentation
==============
All documentation can be found in the doc directory. If you still have questions 
after reading these, check out the website at http://mixim.sourceforge.net. 

To send any kind of feedback, bug reports, feature requests etc. please use the
