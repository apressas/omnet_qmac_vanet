/**
 * @brief The BasePhyLayer represents the physical layer of a nic.
 *
 * The BasePhyLayer is directly connected to the mac layer via
 * OMNeT channels and is able to send messages to other physical
 * layers through sub-classing from ChannelAcces.
 *
 * The BasePhyLayer encapsulates two sub modules.
 * The AnalogueModels, which are responsible for simulating
 * the attenuation of received signals and the Decider which
 * provides the main functionality of the physical layer like
 * signal classification (noise or not noise) and demodulation
 * (calculating transmission errors).
 *
 * The BasePhyLayer itself is responsible for the OMNeT
 * depended parts of the physical layer which are the following:
 *
 * Module initialization:
 * - read ned-parameters and initialize module, Decider and
 *   AnalogueModels.
 *
 * Message handling:
 * - receive messages from mac layer and hand them to the Decider
 *   or directly send them to the channel
 * - receive AirFrames from the channel, hand them to the
 *   AnalogueModels for filtering, simulate delay and transmission
 *   duration, hand it to the Decider for evaluation and send
 *   received packets to the mac layer
 * - keep track of currently active AirFrames on the channel
 *   (see ChannelInfo)
 *
 * The actual evaluation of incoming signals is done by the
 * Decider.
 *
 * base class ChannelAccess:
 * - provides access to the channel via the ConnectionManager
 *
 * base class DeciderToPhyInterface:
 * - interface for the Decider
 *
 * base class MacToPhyInterface:
 * - interface for the Mac
 *
